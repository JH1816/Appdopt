# Appdopt

App IT2002 Project

## Description

Our app, Appdapt, has the domain related to the sharing economy of a platform of pets put up for adoption by other users. 

Before using the application, both adopters and sellers will have to sign up for an account and log in. Sellers can post about the adoption or sale of the pets they currently have (posts have a title, a short description about the pet, species, breed, age of the pet, price, and the date of the post). Adopters can browse through the posts, and contact the pet owners through the application should they be interested in the adoption of the pet. All users can be both a seller or an adopter. The system will track every post and change the status from ‘AVAILABLE’ to ‘SOLD’ should there be a successful transaction. 

Administrators have the right to create, modify or delete all posts as well as accounts. 

## Obtaining data

For emails, phone numbers, usernames, passwords, first names, last names, post IDs, number of animals, date of post, age of pet, price and status, we can randomly generate data from Mockaroo.

For pet species, we will assign a pet species such as dogs, cats, rabbits, guinea pigs and hamsters from the list in NParks https://www.nparks.gov.sg/avs/pets/owning-a-pet/getting-a-pet/animals-allowed-for-sale, where we chose the most popular pets in Singapore. 

For the distribution of the pets, dogs took up roughly 38.5% of total pets, cats took up roughly 29.4% and the rest took up 32.1% (each assumed to be distributed equally at 10.7% each) https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/brunch/paws-perous-business-the-booming-pets-trade-thats-also-feeding-an-illicit-market. 

For the breed of the animal, we can randomly assign one from the list of 10 dog breeds, 10 rabbit breeds, 10 cat breeds, 11 guinea pig breeds or 5 hamster breeds.
