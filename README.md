Before using the application, both adopters and sellers will have to sign up for an account and log in. Sellers can post about the adoption or sale of the pets they currently have (posts have a title, a short description about the pet, species, breed, age of the pet, price, and the date of the post). Adopters can browse through the posts, and contact the pet owners through the application should they be interested in the adoption of the pet. All users can be both a seller or an adopter.
